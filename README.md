high-school-thesis
==================

This is the thesis I presented at the end of the High School courses, in 2009, at the "Liceo Scientifico Piero Gobetti" of Turin.

# IMPORTANT - please reade before

Before reading both the code and the thesis, and before running the project, please consider the following things:

* If you are here **to get an idea** of how I work you are on the **wrong place** (please take a look at my [other repos](github.com/Chosko/?tab=repositories)) because:
  * When I made this project I had just learned to program by myself, so the code IS NOT pretty and contains a lot of bad stuff
  * I developed this project when I was 17-18, without help from anyone, so even with the chance to make mistakes without someone correcting me
  * I'm publishing this project only because it was the first time I made something (virtually) real with my own hands, (and it works!)
* The thesis was written in Italian, and there's not an English version
* The program may not work properly on all the computers

## Content

This repo contains:

* The Thesis (Logix Engine.doc) and the slides used during the presentation of the thesis (Logix Engine.ppt)
* The source code of the project (src folder)
* A working release of the project (Planetario.exe and MEDIA folder). The MEDIA folder must be in the same directory of the executable.

## System Requirements

The program runs only on Windows systems, with DirectX runtime installed.
